uwaterloo-igem-2014
===================

Software for the 2014 University of Waterloo iGEM team.
Visit our [website](http://igem.uwaterloo.ca) or our [2014 wiki page](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Waterloo)
to learn more about our 2014 project, Staphylocide.

This software was mostly created by the mathemtatical modelling team, headed by Jama Hagi-Yusuf.

*  /CRISPRi contains MATLAB models written that describe CRISPR interference, including some
parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Learn more about our CRISPRi model
[on the wiki](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Math_Book/CRISPRi).
*  /Software-CRISPRecise contains the beginnings of a software project to help choose targets for
  CRISPR interference, which is unfinished but will likely be continued next year.
*  /sRNA contains MATLAB models that describe silencing RNA, including sensitivity analysis. Read
   more about our sRNA model [on the wiki](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Math_Book/sRNA).
